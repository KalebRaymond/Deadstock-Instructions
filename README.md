# Deadstock Knot
The deadstock knot, also known as the factory lace, is a fashionable and secure way to tie your shoelaces. Although many consider the technique to be perplexing and elusive, the instructions below will enable you to quickly add extra flare to your outfits.
## Instructions
1. Begin with a completely untied shoe.
2. Hold both ends of each shoelace in a pinch in one hand and pull them straight upwards.
3. With your free hand, pinch the opposite ends of both shoelaces together as close to the tongue of the shoe as possible.
4. Feed the laces through the space between the pointer finger and thumb of the bottom hand.
5. Insert your bottom thumb into the loop around your bottom pointer finger.
6. Using your free hand, pinch the free laces together about a centimeter from the base of the loop.
7. Feed the laces through the loop until you are able to grab the laces with your other hand.
8. Create two new horizontal loops by pulling the laces through the loop only until the length of the laces on either side of the original loop is about equal.
9. Tighten the knot by grabbing the horizontal loops and pulling upwards on the base of the original loop.
